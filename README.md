# Threads
We have created four threads other than main thread. 
1. Input thread 
2. Reverse thread 
3. Capital thread 
4. Shift thread 

Input thread takes string input from user, reverse thread will reverse the string and output it, 
capital thread will capitalize the characters of string and output it and shift thread will shift each 
characters of the string two time (e.g. a will become c) and output it. All the threads wait for input 
thread when input thread finishes his task all the waiting thread start their work simultaneously.
